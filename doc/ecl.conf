# Maps the filename extension .ecl onto the application/x-httpd-ecl MIME type.
#
# If the filename  contains multiple extensions like .ecl.png this  will map the
# file  name   extension  .ecl  and   the  filename  extension  .png   onto  the
# application/x-httpd-ecl MIME type.  This can raise a security problem.
#
# AddType application/x-httpd-ecl .ecl

# Maps the filename  extension .ecl onto the ecl-handler handler  of the mod_ecl
# module.
#
# AddHandler ecl-handler .ecl

# Forces all matching  .ecl files to be processed by  the ecl-handler handler of
# the mod_ecl module.
#
# SetHandler application/x-httpd-ecl
#
# To match all files in the /mod_ecl/ directory put this inside a .htaccess file
# or put  this in the httpd.conf  configuration file in a  Location or Directory
# directive.
#
# <Location /mod_ecl>
#     SetHandler application/x-httpd-ecl
# <Location>
#
# To  match files  with filemane  extension .ecl  put this  inside a  FilesMatch
# directive. This is recommended.
#
# <FilesMatch ".+\.ecl$">
#     SetHandler application/x-httpd-ecl
# <FilesMatch>

<FilesMatch ".+\.ecl$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-ecl
</FilesMatch>

# Deny access to files without filename (e.g. '.ecl')

<FilesMatch "^\.ecl$">
    Require all denied
</FilesMatch>
