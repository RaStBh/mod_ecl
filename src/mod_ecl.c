**  mod_ecl.c -- Apache sample ecl module
**  [Autogenerated via ``apxs -n ecl -g'']
**
**  To play with this sample module first compile it into a
**  DSO file and install it into Apache's modules directory
**  by running:
**
**    $ apxs -c -i mod_ecl.c
**
**  Then activate it in Apache's apache2.conf file for instance
**  for the URL /ecl in as follows:
**
**    #   apache2.conf
**    LoadModule ecl_module modules/mod_ecl.so
**    <Location /ecl>
**    SetHandler ecl
**    </Location>
**
**  Then after restarting Apache via
**
**    $ apachectl restart
**
**  you immediately can request the URL /ecl and watch for the
**  output of this module. This can be achieved for instance via:
**
**    $ lynx -mime_header http://localhost/ecl
**
**  The output should be similar to the following one:
**
**    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
**    Date: Tue, 31 Mar 1998 14:42:22 GMT
**    Server: Apache/1.3.4 (Unix)
**    Connection: close
**    Content-Type: text/html

 * non-HTTP status codes:
 *
 * * [OK](https://ci.apache.org/projects/httpd/trunk/doxygen/group__APACHE__CORE__DAEMON.html#gaba51915c87d64af47fb1cc59348961c9)
 *   --- 0 --- Module has handled this stage.
 *
 * * [DECLINED](https://ci.apache.org/projects/httpd/trunk/doxygen/group__APACHE__CORE__DAEMON.html#ga9eba11ca86461a3ae319311d64682dda)
 *   --- -1 --- Module declines to handle.
 *
 * * [DONE](https://ci.apache.org/projects/httpd/trunk/doxygen/group__APACHE__CORE__DAEMON.html#gabe6b865c045f3e7c6892ef4f15ff5779)
 *   --- -2 --- Module has served the response completely.
 *
 * * [SUSPENDED](https://ci.apache.org/projects/httpd/trunk/doxygen/group__APACHE__CORE__DAEMON.html#gaeb2de2a76ea6728368042cf7a3fcd60c)
 *    --- -3 --- Module will handle the remainder of the request.  The core will
 *    never invoke the request again.
 *
 * HTTP status codes:
 *
 * Each  Status-Code  is  described  below, including  a  description  of  which
 * method(s) it can follow and any metainformation required in the response.
 *
 * * Informational 1xx (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *   This class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting only
 *   of the  Status-Line and  optional headers,  and is  terminated by  an empty
 *   line.  There are no required headers  for this class of status code.  Since
 *   HTTP/1.0 did not define  any 1xx status codes, servers MUST  NOT send a 1xx
 *   response to an HTTP/1.0 client except under experimental conditions.
 *
 *   A client MUST be prepared to accept  one or more 1xx status responses prior
 *   to a regular response, even if the  client does not expect a 100 (Continue)
 *   status message.  Unexpected  1xx status responses MAY be ignored  by a user
 *   agent.
 *
 *   Proxies MUST forward 1xx responses, unless the connection between the proxy
 *   and its  client has been closed,  or unless the proxy  itself requested the
 *   generation of the  1xx response.  (For example, if a  proxy adds a "Expect:
 *   100-continue" field  when it forwards a  request, then it need  not forward
 *   the corresponding 100 (Continue) response(s).)
 *
 * * Informational 1xx (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *   The 1xx (Informational) class of  status code indicates an interim response
 *   for communicating connection status or request progress prior to completing
 *   the  requested action  and sending  a  final response.   1xx responses  are
 *   terminated by  the first empty line  after the status-line (the  empty line
 *   signaling the  end of the header  section).  Since HTTP/1.0 did  not define
 *   any 1xx status codes, a server MUST  NOT send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0
 *   client.
 *
 *   A client MUST be able to parse  one or more 1xx responses received prior to
 *   a final response, even if the client does not expect one.  A user agent MAY
 *   ignore unexpected 1xx responses.
 *
 *   A proxy  MUST forward 1xx responses  unless the proxy itself  requested the
 *   generation of the  1xx response.  For example, if a  proxy adds an "Expect:
 *   100-continue" field  when it forwards a  request, then it need  not forward
 *   the corresponding 100 (Continue) response(s).
 *
 *   * HTTP_CONTINUE --- 100 Continue (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The client  SHOULD continue with  its request.  This interim  response is
 *     used to inform the  client that the initial part of  the request has been
 *     received and has not yet been  rejected by the server.  The client SHOULD
 *     continue by sending  the remainder of the request or,  if the request has
 *     already been  completed, ignore  this response.  The  server MUST  send a
 *     final response after  the request has been completed.   See section 8.2.3
 *     for detailed discussion of the use and handling of this status code.
 *
 *   * HTTP_CONTINUE --- 100 Continue (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The  100 (Continue)  status code  indicates that  the initial  part of  a
 *     request has  been received and has  not yet been rejected  by the server.
 *     The server  intends to send a  final response after the  request has been
 *     fully received and acted upon.
 *
 *     When  the  request  contains  an  Expect header  field  that  includes  a
 *     100-continue  expectation, the  100  response indicates  that the  server
 *     wishes  to receive  the request  payload  body, as  described in  Section
 *     5.1.1.  The client ought to continue  sending the request and discard the
 *     100 response.
 *
 *     If the  request did  not contain  an Expect  header field  containing the
 *     100-continue  expectation, the  client  can simply  discard this  interim
 *     response.
 *
 *   * HTTP_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS --- 101 Switching Protocols (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The  server  understands and  is  willing  to  comply with  the  client's
 *     request,  via the  Upgrade message  header field  (section 14.42),  for a
 *     change in  the application protocol  being used on this  connection.  The
 *     server will switch  protocols to those defined by  the response's Upgrade
 *     header field  immediately after the  empty line which terminates  the 101
 *     response.
 *
 *     The protocol  SHOULD be switched only  when it is advantageous  to do so.
 *     For example,  switching to a newer  version of HTTP is  advantageous over
 *     older versions, and switching to  a real-time, synchronous protocol might
 *     be advantageous when delivering resources that use such features.
 *
 *   * HTTP_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS --- 101 Switching Protocols (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The  101 (Switching  Protocols)  status code  indicates  that the  server
 *     understands and is  willing to comply with the client's  request, via the
 *     Upgrade header  field (Section  6.7 of  [RFC7230]), for  a change  in the
 *     application  protocol being  used on  this connection.   The server  MUST
 *     generate an  Upgrade header  field in the  response that  indicates which
 *     protocol(s) will  be switched  to immediately after  the empty  line that
 *     terminates the 101 response.
 *
 *     It is assumed that the server will only agree to switch protocols when it
 *     is advantageous to  do so.  For example, switching to  a newer version of
 *     HTTP  might be  advantageous  over  older versions,  and  switching to  a
 *     real-time,  synchronous protocol  might be  advantageous when  delivering
 *     resources that use such features.
 *
 *   * HTTP_PROCESSING --- 102 Processing (from RFC 2518)
 *
 *     The 102  (Processing) status code is  an interim response used  to inform
 *     the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not
 *     yet completed it.   This status code SHOULD only be  sent when the server
 *     has a reasonable expectation that  the request will take significant time
 *     to complete.  As  guidance, if a method is taking  longer than 20 seconds
 *     (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a
 *     102 (Processing) response.   The server MUST send a  final response after
 *     the request has been completed.
 *
 *     Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process, especially
 *     methods that  support the  Depth header.   In such  cases the  client may
 *     time-out the  connection while waiting  for a response.  To  prevent this
 *     the server may  return a 102 (Processing) status code  to indicate to the
 *     client that the server is still processing the method.
 *
 * * Successful 2xx (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *   This  class  of  status  code  indicates  that  the  client's  request  was
 *   successfully received, understood, and accepted.
 *
 * * Successful 2xx (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *   The  2xx (Successful)  class of  status  code indicates  that the  client's
 *   request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
 *
 *   * HTTP_OK --- 200 OK (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The request has succeeded.  The information returned with the response is
 *     dependent on the method used in the request, for example:
 *
 *     GET --- an entity corresponding to  the requested resource is sent in the
 *       response;
 *
 *     HEAD --- the entity-header fields corresponding to the requested resource
 *       are sent in the response without any message-body;
 *
 *     POST --- an entity describing or containing the result of the action;
 *
 *     TRACE an  entity containing the  request message  as received by  the end
 *       server.
 *
 *   * HTTP_OK --- 200 OK (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 200 (OK)  status code indicates that the request  has succeeded.  The
 *     payload sent  in a 200 response  depends on the request  method.  For the
 *     methods  defined  by this  specification,  the  intended meaning  of  the
 *     payload can be summarized as:
 *
 *     GET --- a representation of the target resource;
 *
 *     HEAD --- the  same representation as GET, but  without the representation
 *     data;
 *
 *     POST --- a representation of the status of, or results obtained from, the
 *     action;
 *
 *     PUT, DELETE --- a representation of the status of the action;
 *
 *     OPTIONS --- a representation of the communications options;
 *
 *     TRACE --- a representation of the  request message as received by the end
 *     server.
 *
 *     Aside from  responses to CONNECT,  a 200  response always has  a payload,
 *     though an origin  server MAY generate a payload body  of zero length.  If
 *     no payload  is desired, an origin  server ought to send  204 (No Content)
 *     instead.   For CONNECT,  no  payload is  allowed  because the  successful
 *     result  is a  tunnel, which  begins  immediately after  the 200  response
 *     header section.
 *
 *     A 200 response is cacheable  by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
 *     by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
 *     [RFC7234]).
 *
 *   * HTTP_CREATED --- 201 Created (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The  request has  been fulfilled  and resulted  in a  new resource  being
 *     created.   The newly  created resource  can be  referenced by  the URI(s)
 *     returned in  the entity of the  response, with the most  specific URI for
 *     the  resource given  by a  Location  header field.   The response  SHOULD
 *     include  an entity  containing  a list  of  resource characteristics  and
 *     location(s) from  which the user  or user agent  can choose the  one most
 *     appropriate.  The entity  format is specified by the media  type given in
 *     the  Content-Type  header  field.   The origin  server  MUST  create  the
 *     resource before returning  the 201 status code.  If the  action cannot be
 *     carried out  immediately, the server  SHOULD respond with  202 (Accepted)
 *     response instead.
 *
 *     A 201 response  MAY contain an ETag response header  field indicating the
 *     current value of  the entity tag for the requested  variant just created,
 *     see section 14.19.
 *
 *   * HTTP_CREATED --- 201 Created (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The  201  (Created) status  code  indicates  that  the request  has  been
 *     fulfilled and  has resulted in one  or more new resources  being created.
 *     The primary  resource created by  the request  is identified by  either a
 *     Location  header field  in  the  response or,  if  no  Location field  is
 *     received, by the effective request URI.
 *
 *     The 201 response payload typically describes and links to the resource(s)
 *     created.  See Section 7.2 for a discussion of the meaning and purpose of
 *     validator header fields, such as ETag and Last-Modified, in a 201
 *     response.
 *
 *   * HTTP_ACCEPTED --- 202 Accepted (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The request has been accepted for  processing, but the processing has not
 *     been completed.  The request might or might not eventually be acted upon,
 *     as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place.  There is
 *     no facility for  re-sending a status code from  an asynchronous operation
 *     such as this.
 *
 *     The 202 response is intentionally non-committal.  Its purpose is to allow
 *     a  server  to  accept  a  request  for  some  other  process  (perhaps  a
 *     batch-oriented process that  is only run once per  day) without requiring
 *     that the user agent's connection to  the server persist until the process
 *     is completed.  The  entity returned with this response  SHOULD include an
 *     indication of  the request's  current status  and either  a pointer  to a
 *     status monitor or  some estimate of when the user  can expect the request
 *     to be fulfilled.
 *
 *   * HTTP_ACCEPTED --- 202 Accepted (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The  202 (Accepted)  status  code  indicates that  the  request has  been
 *     accepted for processing, but the  processing has not been completed.  The
 *     request  might or  might not  eventually be  acted upon,  as it  might be
 *     disallowed when processing actually takes place.  There is no facility in
 *     HTTP for re-sending a status code from an asynchronous operation.
 *
 *     The 202 response is intentionally  noncommittal.  Its purpose is to allow
 *     a  server  to  accept  a  request  for  some  other  process  (perhaps  a
 *     batch-oriented process that  is only run once per  day) without requiring
 *     that the user agent's connection to  the server persist until the process
 *     is  completed.   The representation  sent  with  this response  ought  to
 *     describe the  request's current status and  point to (or embed)  a status
 *     monitor that  can provide the user  with an estimate of  when the request
 *     will be fulfilled.
 *
 *   * HTTP_NON_AUTHORITATIVE  --- 203  Non-Authoritative Information  (from RFC
 *     2616)
 *
 *     The returned metainformation  in the entity-header is  not the definitive
 *     set as available from the origin server,  but is gathered from a local or
 *     a third-party copy.  The set presented MAY be a subset or superset of the
 *     original version.   For example,  including local  annotation information
 *     about  the resource  might result  in a  superset of  the metainformation
 *     known by  the origin server.  Use  of this response code  is not required
 *     and is only appropriate when the response would otherwise be 200 (OK).
 *
 *   * HTTP_NON_AUTHORITATIVE  --- 203  Non-Authoritative Information  (from RFC
 *     7231)
 *
 *     The 203  (Non-Authoritative Information)  status code indicates  that the
 *     request was  successful but the  enclosed payload has been  modified from
 *     that of  the origin server's  200 (OK)  response by a  transforming proxy
 *     (Section  5.7.2 of  [RFC7230]).  This  status  code allows  the proxy  to
 *     notify  recipients when  a transformation  has been  applied, since  that
 *     knowledge  might  impact  later  decisions regarding  the  content.   For
 *     example, future cache  validation requests for the content  might only be
 *     applicable along the same request path (through the same proxies).
 *
 *     The 203  response is similar  to the  Warning code of  214 Transformation
 *     Applied  (Section 5.5  of [RFC7234]),  which has  the advantage  of being
 *     applicable to responses with any status code.
 *
 *     A 203 response is cacheable  by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
 *     by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
 *     [RFC7234]).
 *
 *   * HTTP_NO_CONTENT --- 204 No Content (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The  server has  fulfilled the  request but  does not  need to  return an
 *     entity-body,  and  might want  to  return  updated metainformation.   The
 *     response  MAY include  new  or  updated metainformation  in  the form  of
 *     entity-headers, which if present SHOULD  be associated with the requested
 *     variant.
 *
 *     If the  client is a  user agent, it SHOULD  NOT change its  document view
 *     from  that  which caused  the  request  to  be  sent.  This  response  is
 *     primarily  intended to  allow input  for  actions to  take place  without
 *     causing a change  to the user agent's active document  view, although any
 *     new  or  updated  metainformation  SHOULD  be  applied  to  the  document
 *     currently in the user agent's active view.
 *
 *     The 204  response MUST  NOT include  a message-body,  and thus  is always
 *     terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.
 *
 *   * HTTP_NO_CONTENT --- 204 No Content (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The  204  (No  Content)  status   code  indicates  that  the  server  has
 *     successfully  fulfilled  the request  and  that  there is  no  additional
 *     content to send  in the response payload body.  Metadata  in the response
 *     header   fields  refer   to  the   target  resource   and  its   selected
 *     representation after the requested action was applied.
 *
 *     For  example, if  a 204  status code  is received  in response  to a  PUT
 *     request and the response contains an  ETag header field, then the PUT was
 *     successful and the  ETag field-value contains the entity-tag  for the new
 *     representation of that target resource.
 *
 *     The 204  response allows a  server to indicate  that the action  has been
 *     successfully applied to the target resource, while implying that the user
 *     agent does not need to traverse away from its current "document view" (if
 *     any).   The  server  assumes  that  the  user  agent  will  provide  some
 *     indication of the success to its  user, in accord with its own interface,
 *     and  apply any  new or  updated metadata  in the  response to  its active
 *     representation.
 *
 *     For example,  a 204 status  code is  commonly used with  document editing
 *     interfaces corresponding to a "save" action, such that the document being
 *     saved remains available  to the user for editing.  It  is also frequently
 *     used  with  interfaces  that  expect   automated  data  transfers  to  be
 *     prevalent, such as within distributed version control systems.
 *
 *     A 204  response is terminated  by the first  empty line after  the header
 *     fields because it cannot contain a message body.
 *
 *     A 204 response is cacheable  by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
 *     by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
 *     [RFC7234]).
 *
 *   * HTTP_RESET_CONTENT --- 205 Reset Content (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The server has fulfilled the request  and the user agent SHOULD reset the
 *     document view  which caused  the request  to be  sent.  This  response is
 *     primarily intended  to allow  input for  actions to  take place  via user
 *     input, followed by a clearing of the  form in which the input is given so
 *     that the  user can  easily initiate another  input action.   The response
 *     MUST NOT include an entity.
 *
 *   * HTTP_RESET_CONTENT --- 205 Reset Content (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The  205  (Reset Content)  status  code  indicates  that the  server  has
 *     fulfilled the request and desires that the user agent reset the "document
 *     view", which  caused the  request to  be sent, to  its original  state as
 *     received from the origin server.
 *
 *     This response is  intended to support a common data  entry use case where
 *     the  user receives  content that  supports data  entry (a  form, notepad,
 *     canvas,  etc.), enters  or manipulates  data  in that  space, causes  the
 *     entered  data to  be submitted  in  a request,  and then  the data  entry
 *     mechanism  is reset  for  the next  entry  so that  the  user can  easily
 *     initiate another input action.
 *
 *     Since the  205 status  code implies  that no  additional content  will be
 *     provided, a  server MUST NOT  generate a payload  in a 205  response.  In
 *     other words, a server MUST do one of the following for a 205 response: a)
 *     indicate   a  zero-length   body  for   the  response   by  including   a
 *     Content-Length header field with a value  of 0; b) indicate a zero-length
 *     payload for  the response by  including a Transfer-Encoding  header field
 *     with a value of  chunked and a message body consisting  of a single chunk
 *     of zero-length; or, c) close the connection immediately after sending the
 *     blank line terminating the header section.
 *
 *   * HTTP_PARTIAL_CONTENT --- 206 Partial Content (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The server has  fulfilled the partial GET request for  the resource.  The
 *     request  MUST  have  included  a   Range  header  field  (section  14.35)
 *     indicating the  desired range, and  MAY have included an  If-Range header
 *     field (section 14.27) to make the request conditional.
 *
 *     The response MUST include the following header fields:
 *
 *     * Either  a Content-Range  header  field (section  14.16) indicating  the
 *       range   included  with   this  response,   or  a   multipart/byteranges
 *       Content-Type  including  Content-Range  fields  for each  part.   If  a
 *       Content-Length header field is present  in the response, its value MUST
 *       match the actual number of OCTETs transmitted in the message-body.
 *
 *     * Date
 *
 *     * ETag and/or Content-Location,  if the header would have been  sent in a
 *       200 response to the same request
 *
 *     * Expires, Cache-Control,  and/or Vary,  if the field-value  might differ
 *       from that sent in any previous response for the same variant
 *
 *     If the  206 response  is the result  of an If-Range  request that  used a
 *     strong  cache validator  (see section  13.3.3), the  response SHOULD  NOT
 *     include  other entity-headers.   If  the  response is  the  result of  an
 *     If-Range  request that  used  a  weak validator,  the  response MUST  NOT
 *     include  other  entity-headers;  this  prevents  inconsistencies  between
 *     cached entity-bodies  and updated headers.  Otherwise,  the response MUST
 *     include all  of the entity-headers that  would have been returned  with a
 *     200 (OK) response to the same request.
 *
 *     A cache  MUST NOT  combine a  206 response  with other  previously cached
 *     content if  the ETag or Last-Modified  headers do not match  exactly, see
 *     13.5.4.
 *
 *     A cache that does not support the Range and Content-Range headers
 *     MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial) responses.
 *
 *   * HTTP_MULTI_STATUS --- 207 Multi-Status (from RFC 2518)
 *
 *     The  207   (Multi-Status)  status  code  provides   status  for  multiple
 *     independent operations (see section 11 for more information).
 *
 *   * HTTP_MULTI_STATUS --- 207 Multi-Status (from RFC 4918)
 *
 *     The  207   (Multi-Status)  status  code  provides   status  for  multiple
 *     independent operations (see Section 13 for more information).
 *
 *   * HTTP_ALREADY_REPORTED --- 208 Already Reported (from RFC 5842)
 *
 *     The 208 (Already Reported) status code can be used inside a DAV: propstat
 *     response element  to avoid enumerating  the internal members  of multiple
 *     bindings  to the  same  collection  repeatedly.  For  each  binding to  a
 *     collection inside the  request's scope, only one will be  reported with a
 *     200 status, while subsequent DAV:response elements for all other bindings
 *     will  use  the  208  status,  and  no  DAV:response  elements  for  their
 *     descendants are included.
 *
 *     Note that the 208 status will  only occur for "Depth: infinity" requests,
 *     and  that it  is of  particular importance  when the  multiple collection
 *     bindings cause a bind loop as discussed in Section 2.2.
 *
 *     A client can  request the DAV:resource-id property in  a PROPFIND request
 *     to guarantee that  they can accurately reconstruct  the binding structure
 *     of a collection with multiple bindings to a single resource.
 *
 *     For backward compatibility with clients not  aware of the 208 status code
 *     appearing in  multistatus response bodies,  it SHOULD NOT be  used unless
 *     the client  has signaled support  for this specification using  the "DAV"
 *     request  header (see  Section  8.2).   Instead, a  508  status should  be
 *     returned when  a binding loop is  discovered.  This allows the  server to
 *     return the 508 as the top-level  return status, if it discovers it before
 *     it  started the  response,  or in  the  middle of  a  multistatus, if  it
 *     discovers it in the middle of streaming out a multistatus response.
 *
 *   * HTTP_IM_USED --- 226 IM Used (from RFC 3229)
 *
 *     The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response
 *     is a representation  of the result of one  or more instance-manipulations
 *     applied to the  current instance.  The actual current  instance might not
 *     be available  except by  combining this response  with other  previous or
 *     future     responses,     as     appropriate     for     the     specific
 *     instance-manipulation(s).  If  so, the headers of  the resulting instance
 *     are the result of combining the  headers from the status-226 response and
 *     the  other  instances, following  the  rules  in  section 13.5.3  of  the
 *     HTTP/1.1 specification [10].
 *
 *     The request MUST have included an  A-IM header field listing at least one
 *     instance-manipulation.  The  response MUST  include an Etag  header field
 *     giving the entity tag of the current instance.
 *
 *     A response received  with a status code  of 226 MAY be stored  by a cache
 *     and used in reply to a subsequent request, subject to the HTTP expiration
 *     mechanism  and any  Cache-Control  headers, and  to  the requirements  in
 *     section 10.6.
 *
 *     A response received with a status code of  226 MAY be used by a cache, in
 *     conjunction with a  cache entry for the base instance,  to create a cache
 *     entry for the current instance.
 *
 * * Redirection 3xx (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *   This class of  status code indicates that further action  needs to be taken
 *   by the user agent in order to fulfill the request.  The action required MAY
 *   be carried out by  the user agent without interaction with  the user if and
 *   only if  the method used in  the second request  is GET or HEAD.   A client
 *   SHOULD detect infinite redirection loops, since such loops generate network
 *   traffic for each redirection.
 *
 *   Note: previous versions of this specification recommended a maximum of five
 *   redirections.   Content developers  should  be aware  that  there might  be
 *   clients that implement such a fixed limitation.
 *
 * * Redirection 3xx (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *   The 3xx  (Redirection) class of  status code indicates that  further action
 *   needs to be taken by the user agent  in order to fulfill the request.  If a
 *   Location  header field  (Section 7.1.2)  is  provided, the  user agent  MAY
 *   automatically redirect  its request to  the URI referenced by  the Location
 *   field value, even if the specific status code is not understood.  Automatic
 *   redirection needs to  done with care for  methods not known to  be safe, as
 *   defined in  Section 4.2.1,  since the  user might not  wish to  redirect an
 *   unsafe request.
 *
 *   There are several types of redirects:
 *
 *   1. Redirects that  indicate the resource might be available  at a different
 *      URI,  as provided  by the  Location field,  as in  the status  codes 301
 *      (Moved Permanently), 302 (Found), and 307 (Temporary Redirect).
 *
 *   2. Redirection that offers a choice  of matching resources, each capable of
 *      representing  the  original request  target,  as  in the  300  (Multiple
 *      Choices) status code.
 *
 *   3. Redirection to  a different resource, identified by  the Location field,
 *      that can  represent an indirect response  to the request, as  in the 303
 *      (See Other) status code.
 *
 *   4. Redirection to a previously cached  result, as in the 304 (Not Modified)
 *      status code.
 *
 *   Note: In HTTP/1.0, the status codes 301 (Moved Permanently) and 302 (Found)
 *   were  defined for  the first  type  of redirect  ([RFC1945], Section  9.3).
 *   Early  user agents  split on  whether the  method applied  to the  redirect
 *   target would be the  same as the original request or  would be rewritten as
 *   GET.  Although HTTP originally defined the former semantics for 301 and 302
 *   (to match its original implementation at CERN), and defined 303 (See Other)
 *   to match the  latter semantics, prevailing practice  gradually converged on
 *   the  latter semantics  for 301  and  302 as  well.  The  first revision  of
 *   HTTP/1.1 added  307 (Temporary Redirect)  to indicate the  former semantics
 *   without being  impacted by divergent  practice.  Over 10 years  later, most
 *   user agents  still do  method rewriting  for 301  and 302;  therefore, this
 *   specification makes that  behavior conformant when the  original request is
 *   POST.
 *
 *   A  client  SHOULD detect  and  intervene  in cyclical  redirections  (i.e.,
 *   "infinite" redirection loops).
 *
 *   Note: An  earlier version  of this specification  recommended a  maximum of
 *   five redirections ([RFC2068], Section 10.3).  Content developers need to be
 *   aware that some clients might implement such a fixed limitation.
 *
 *   * HTTP_MULTIPLE_CHOICES --- 300 Multiple Choices (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The   requested  resource   corresponds  to   any   one  of   a  set   of
 *     representations, each  with its  own specific location,  and agent-driven
 *     negotiation information (section  12) is being provided so  that the user
 *     (or user  agent) can select  a preferred representation and  redirect its
 *     request to that location.
 *
 *     Unless  it was  a HEAD  request, the  response SHOULD  include an  entity
 *     containing a list of resource  characteristics and location(s) from which
 *     the user or  user agent can choose the one  most appropriate.  The entity
 *     format is  specified by the media  type given in the  Content-Type header
 *     field.  Depending upon the format and the capabilities of the user agent,
 *     selection of the most appropriate  choice MAY be performed automatically.
 *     However,  this  specification  does  not define  any  standard  for  such
 *     automatic selection.
 *
 *     If the server has a preferred choice of representation, it SHOULD include
 *     the  specific URI  for that  representation in  the Location  field; user
 *     agents MAY use the Location  field value for automatic redirection.  This
 *     response is cacheable unless indicated otherwise.
 *
 *   * HTTP_MULTIPLE_CHOICES --- 300 Multiple Choices (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 300 (Multiple Choices) status code indicates that the target resource
 *     has  more  than one  representation,  each  with  its own  more  specific
 *     identifier, and information  about the alternatives is  being provided so
 *     that the  user (or user agent)  can select a preferred  representation by
 *     redirecting its  request to one or  more of those identifiers.   In other
 *     words,  the  server  desires  that  the user  agent  engage  in  reactive
 *     negotiation  to select  the  most appropriate  representation(s) for  its
 *     needs (Section 3.4).
 *
 *     If  the server  has  a preferred  choice, the  server  SHOULD generate  a
 *     Location header field containing a preferred choice's URI reference.  The
 *     user agent MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection.
 *
 *     For request methods other than HEAD, the server SHOULD generate a payload
 *     in the 300 response containing a  list of representation metadata and URI
 *     reference(s) from  which the user or  user agent can choose  the one most
 *     preferred.   The  user  agent  MAY   make  a  selection  from  that  list
 *     automatically  if it  understands the  provided media  type.  A  specific
 *     format  for automatic  selection  is not  defined  by this  specification
 *     because  HTTP  tries  to  remain  orthogonal to  the  definition  of  its
 *     payloads.  In  practice, the  representation is  provided in  some easily
 *     parsed format believed to be acceptable  to the user agent, as determined
 *     by shared  design or  content negotiation, or  in some  commonly accepted
 *     hypertext format.
 *
 *     A 300 response is cacheable  by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
 *     by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
 *     [RFC7234]).
 *
 *     Note:  The original  proposal for  the 300  status code  defined the  URI
 *     header field  as providing  a list  of alternative  representations, such
 *     that  it  would  be  usable  for  200, 300,  and  406  responses  and  be
 *     transferred in responses to the HEAD method.  However, lack of deployment
 *     and disagreement over syntax led to both URI and Alternates (a subsequent
 *     proposal)  being dropped  from  this specification.   It  is possible  to
 *     communicate the  list using a set  of Link header fields  [RFC5988], each
 *     with   a   relationship   of   "alternate",  though   deployment   is   a
 *     chicken-and-egg problem.
 *
 *   * HTTP_MOVED_PERMANENTLY --- 301 Moved Permanently (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The requested  resource has  been assigned  a new  permanent URI  and any
 *     future references to  this resource SHOULD use one of  the returned URIs.
 *     Clients  with link  editing capabilities  ought to  automatically re-link
 *     references  to the  Request-URI  to one  or more  of  the new  references
 *     returned  by the  server,  where possible.   This  response is  cacheable
 *     unless indicated otherwise.
 *
 *     The  new permanent  URI SHOULD  be  given by  the Location  field in  the
 *     response.  Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response
 *     SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).
 *
 *     If the 301  status code is received  in response to a  request other than
 *     GET or HEAD,  the user agent MUST NOT automatically  redirect the request
 *     unless  it can  be confirmed  by the  user, since  this might  change the
 *     conditions under which the request was issued.
 *
 *     Note: When automatically redirecting a POST request after receiving a 301
 *     status code, some  existing HTTP/1.0 user agents  will erroneously change
 *     it into a GET request.
 *
 *   * HTTP_MOVED_PERMANENTLY --- 301 Moved Permanently (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The  301  (Moved  Permanently)  status code  indicates  that  the  target
 *     resource has been assigned a new  permanent URI and any future references
 *     to this  resource ought to  use one of  the enclosed URIs.   Clients with
 *     link-editing capabilities  ought to  automatically re-link  references to
 *     the effective request  URI to one or  more of the new  references sent by
 *     the server, where possible.
 *
 *     The  server SHOULD  generate  a  Location header  field  in the  response
 *     containing a preferred URI reference for the new permanent URI.  The user
 *     agent MAY  use the Location  field value for automatic  redirection.  The
 *     server's response payload usually contains  a short hypertext note with a
 *     hyperlink to the new URI(s).
 *
 *     Note: For historical reasons, a user  agent MAY change the request method
 *     from  POST to  GET  for  the subsequent  request.   If  this behavior  is
 *     undesired, the 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code can be used instead.
 *
 *     A 301 response is cacheable  by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
 *     by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
 *     [RFC7234]).
 *
 *   * HTTP_MOVED_TEMPORARILY --- 302 Found (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The requested resource resides temporarily  under a different URI.  Since
 *     the redirection might be altered  on occasion, the client SHOULD continue
 *     to  use the  Request-URI  for  future requests.   This  response is  only
 *     cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.
 *
 *     The temporary URI SHOULD be given  by the Location field in the response.
 *     Unless the  request method was  HEAD, the  entity of the  response SHOULD
 *     contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).
 *
 *     If the 302  status code is received  in response to a  request other than
 *     GET or HEAD,  the user agent MUST NOT automatically  redirect the request
 *     unless  it can  be confirmed  by the  user, since  this might  change the
 *     conditions under which the request was issued.
 *
 *     Note: RFC  1945 and RFC  2068 specify that the  client is not  allowed to
 *     change the method on the redirected request.  However, most existing user
 *     agent implementations treat 302 as if  it were a 303 response, performing
 *     a  GET on  the Location  field-value regardless  of the  original request
 *     method.  The  status codes 303 and  307 have been added  for servers that
 *     wish to  make unambiguously clear which  kind of reaction is  expected of
 *     the client.
 *
 *   * HTTP_MOVED_TEMPORARILY --- 302 Found (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 302  (Found) status code  indicates that the target  resource resides
 *     temporarily  under  a different  URI.   Since  the redirection  might  be
 *     altered on  occasion, the client ought  to continue to use  the effective
 *     request URI for future requests.
 *
 *     The  server SHOULD  generate  a  Location header  field  in the  response
 *     containing a URI reference for the different URI.  The user agent MAY use
 *     the  Location  field  value  for  automatic  redirection.   The  server's
 *     response payload usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink
 *     to the different URI(s).
 *
 *     Note: For historical reasons, a user  agent MAY change the request method
 *     from  POST to  GET  for  the subsequent  request.   If  this behavior  is
 *     undesired, the 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code can be used instead.
 *
 *   * HTTP_SEE_OTHER --- 303 See Other (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The response to the request can be found under a different URI and SHOULD
 *     be retrieved  using a GET  method on  that resource.  This  method exists
 *     primarily to allow the output of  a POST-activated script to redirect the
 *     user  agent to  a selected  resource.  The  new URI  is not  a substitute
 *     reference for the  originally requested resource.  The  303 response MUST
 *     NOT be cached, but the response  to the second (redirected) request might
 *     be cacheable.
 *
 *     The different URI SHOULD be given  by the Location field in the response.
 *     Unless the  request method was  HEAD, the  entity of the  response SHOULD
 *     contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).
 *
 *     Note: Many  pre-HTTP/1.1 user  agents do not  understand the  303 status.
 *     When interoperability with such clients is a concern, the 302 status code
 *     may be used  instead, since most user  agents react to a  302 response as
 *     described here for 303.
 *
 *   * HTTP_SEE_OTHER --- 303 See Other (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 303 (See Other) status code  indicates that the server is redirecting
 *     the user  agent to  a different resource,  as indicated by  a URI  in the
 *     Location header field, which is  intended to provide an indirect response
 *     to the  original request.  A user  agent can perform a  retrieval request
 *     targeting that  URI (a GET  or HEAD request  if using HTTP),  which might
 *     also be redirected,  and present the eventual result as  an answer to the
 *     original request.  Note that the new  URI in the Location header field is
 *     not considered equivalent to the effective request URI.
 *
 *     This status code is applicable to  any HTTP method.  It is primarily used
 *     to allow  the output of  a POST  action to redirect  the user agent  to a
 *     selected resource, since doing  so provides the information corresponding
 *     to  the POST  response  in  a form  that  can  be separately  identified,
 *     bookmarked, and cached, independent of the original request.
 *
 *     A 303 response to a GET request indicates that the origin server does not
 *     have a representation  of the target resource that can  be transferred by
 *     the server  over HTTP.   However, the  Location field  value refers  to a
 *     resource that is  descriptive of the target resource, such  that making a
 *     retrieval request on that other resource might result in a representation
 *     that  is useful  to recipients  without implying  that it  represents the
 *     original target resource.  Note that answers to the questions of what can
 *     be represented,  what representations are  adequate, and what might  be a
 *     useful description are outside the scope of HTTP.
 *
 *     Except  for responses  to a  HEAD request,  the representation  of a  303
 *     response ought to contain a short  hypertext note with a hyperlink to the
 *     same URI reference provided in the Location header field.
 *
 *   * HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED --- 304 Not Modified (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     If  the client  has performed  a conditional  GET request  and access  is
 *     allowed,  but the  document  has  not been  modified,  the server  SHOULD
 *     respond  with this  status code.   The 304  response MUST  NOT contain  a
 *     message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after
 *     the header fields.
 *
 *     The response MUST include the following header fields:
 *
 *     * Date, unless its omission is required by section 14.18.1
 *
 *     If a clockless  origin server obeys these rules, and  proxies and clients
 *     add  their own  Date to  any response  received without  one (as  already
 *     specified by [RFC 2068], section 14.19), caches will operate correctly.
 *
 *     * ETag and/or Content-Location,  if the header would have been  sent in a
 *       200 response to the same request
 *
 *     * Expires, Cache-Control,  and/or Vary,  if the field-value  might differ
 *       from that sent in any previous response for the same variant
 *
 *     If  the  conditional GET  used  a  strong  cache validator  (see  section
 *     13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers.  Otherwise
 *     (i.e., the conditional GET used a  weak validator), the response MUST NOT
 *     include  other  entity-headers;  this  prevents  inconsistencies  between
 *     cached entity-bodies and updated headers.
 *
 *     If a  304 response  indicates an  entity not  currently cached,  then the
 *     cache  MUST disregard  the response  and repeat  the request  without the
 *     conditional.
 *
 *     If a  cache uses  a received 304  response to update  a cache  entry, the
 *     cache MUST update the entry to reflect  any new field values given in the
 *     response.
 *
 *   * HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED --- 304 Not Modified (from RFC 7232)
 *
 *     The 304  (Not Modified) status code  indicates that a conditional  GET or
 *     HEAD request  has been  received and  would have resulted  in a  200 (OK)
 *     response if  it were  not for  the fact that  the condition  evaluated to
 *     false.  In  other words, there  is no need for  the server to  transfer a
 *     representation of the target resource  because the request indicates that
 *     the  client, which  made the  request  conditional, already  has a  valid
 *     representation; the  server is therefore  redirecting the client  to make
 *     use of that stored representation as if it were the payload of a 200 (OK)
 *     response.
 *
 *     The server generating  a 304 response MUST generate any  of the following
 *     header fields  that would have  been sent in a  200 (OK) response  to the
 *     same request:  Cache-Control, Content-Location, Date, ETag,  Expires, and
 *     Vary.
 *
 *     Since the goal of a 304 response is to minimize information transfer when
 *     the recipient  already has one  or more cached representations,  a sender
 *     SHOULD NOT generate  representation metadata other than  the above listed
 *     fields  unless said  metadata exists  for  the purpose  of guiding  cache
 *     updates (e.g.,  Last-Modified might  be useful if  the response  does not
 *     have an ETag field).
 *
 *     Requirements  on a  cache that  receives a  304 response  are defined  in
 *     Section 4.3.4 of  [RFC7234].  If the conditional  request originated with
 *     an outbound  client, such as  a user agent with  its own cache  sending a
 *     conditional GET to a shared proxy,  then the proxy SHOULD forward the 304
 *     response to that client.
 *
 *     A 304 response cannot contain a  message-body; it is always terminated by
 *     the first empty line after the header fields.
 *
 *   * HTTP_USE_PROXY --- 305 Use Proxy (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The requested  resource MUST be accessed  through the proxy given  by the
 *     Location field.   The Location  field gives  the URI  of the  proxy.  The
 *     recipient is expected  to repeat this single request via  the proxy.  305
 *     responses MUST only be generated by origin servers.
 *
 *     Note: RFC 2068 was  not clear that 305 was intended  to redirect a single
 *     request, and to be generated by origin servers only.  Not observing these
 *     limitations has significant security consequences.
 *
 *   * HTTP_USE_PROXY --- 305 Use Proxy (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 305 (Use Proxy) status code was defined in a previous version of this
 *     specification and is now deprecated (Appendix B).
 *
 *   * ??? --- 306 (Unused) (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The 306 status code was used  in a previous version of the specification,
 *     is no longer used, and the code is reserved.
 *
 *   * ??? --- 306 (Unused) (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The  306  status  code  was  defined   in  a  previous  version  of  this
 *     specification, is no longer used, and the code is reserved.
 *
 *   * HTTP_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT --- 307 Temporary Redirect (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The requested resource resides temporarily  under a different URI.  Since
 *     the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to
 *     use the Request-URI for future requests.  This response is only cacheable
 *     if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.
 *
 *     The temporary URI SHOULD be given  by the Location field in the response.
 *     Unless the  request method was  HEAD, the  entity of the  response SHOULD
 *     contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s) , since
 *     many  pre-HTTP/1.1  user  agents  do   not  understand  the  307  status.
 *     Therefore, the note  SHOULD contain the information necessary  for a user
 *     to repeat the original request on the new URI.
 *
 *     If the 307  status code is received  in response to a  request other than
 *     GET or HEAD,  the user agent MUST NOT automatically  redirect the request
 *     unless  it can  be confirmed  by the  user, since  this might  change the
 *     conditions under which the request was issued.
 *
 *   * HTTP_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT --- 307 Temporary Redirect (from RFC  7231)
 *
 *     The  307  (Temporary Redirect)  status  code  indicates that  the  target
 *     resource resides  temporarily under  a different URI  and the  user agent
 *     MUST  NOT  change  the  request   method  if  it  performs  an  automatic
 *     redirection to that URI.  Since the redirection can change over time, the
 *     client ought  to continue  using the original  effective request  URI for
 *     future requests.
 *
 *     The  server SHOULD  generate  a  Location header  field  in the  response
 *     containing a URI reference for the different URI.  The user agent MAY use
 *     the  Location  field  value  for  automatic  redirection.   The  server's
 *     response payload usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink
 *     to the different URI(s).
 *
 *     Note: This status code is similar to 302 (Found), except that it does not
 *     allow changing the  request method from POST to  GET.  This specification
 *     defines no equivalent counterpart for 301 (Moved Permanently) ([RFC7238],
 *     however,  defines  the status  code  308  (Permanent Redirect)  for  this
 *     purpose).
 *
 *   * HTTP_PERMANENT_REDIRECT --- 308 Permanent Redirect (from RFC 7538)
 *
 *     The  308  (Permanent Redirect)  status  code  indicates that  the  target
 *     resource has been assigned a new  permanent URI and any future references
 *     to this  resource ought to  use one of  the enclosed URIs.   Clients with
 *     link editing  capabilities ought  to automatically re-link  references to
 *     the effective  request URI (Section 5.5  of [RFC7230]) to one  or more of
 *     the new references sent by the server, where possible.
 *
 *     The server  SHOULD generate a  Location header field  ([RFC7231], Section
 *     7.1.2) in the  response containing a preferred URI reference  for the new
 *     permanent  URI.  The  user agent  MAY use  the Location  field value  for
 *     automatic redirection.  The server's  response payload usually contains a
 *     short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).
 *
 *     A 308 response is cacheable  by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
 *     by  the method  definition  or explicit  cache  controls (see  [RFC7234],
 *     Section 4.2.2).
 *
 *     Note: This status code is  similar to 301 (Moved Permanently) ([RFC7231],
 *     Section 6.4.2), except that it does not allow changing the request method
 *     from POST to GET.
 *
 * * Client Error 4xx (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *   The 4xx  class of  status code is  intended for cases  in which  the client
 *   seems to have erred.  Except when  responding to a HEAD request, the server
 *   SHOULD include an entity containing  an explanation of the error situation,
 *   and whether it  is a temporary or permanent condition.   These status codes
 *   are  applicable to  any request  method.   User agents  SHOULD display  any
 *   included entity to the user.
 *
 *   If the client is sending data,  a server implementation using TCP SHOULD be
 *   careful to  ensure that  the client acknowledges  receipt of  the packet(s)
 *   containing the response, before the server closes the input connection.  If
 *   the  client continues  sending  data to  the server  after  the close,  the
 *   server's TCP stack will send a reset  packet to the client, which may erase
 *   the  client's unacknowledged  input buffers  before  they can  be read  and
 *   interpreted by the HTTP application.
 *
 * * Client Error 4xx (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *   The 4xx (Client Error) class of status code indicates that the client seems
 *   to have erred.  Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD
 *   send a representation containing an explanation of the error situation, and
 *   whether it is  a temporary or permanent condition.  These  status codes are
 *   applicable to any request method.   User agents SHOULD display any included
 *   representation to the user.
 *
 *   * HTTP_BAD_REQUEST --- 400 Bad Request (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The  request could  not  be understood  by the  server  due to  malformed
 *     syntax.  The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications.
 *
 *   * HTTP_BAD_REQUEST --- 400 Bad Request (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 400  (Bad Request) status  code indicates  that the server  cannot or
 *     will not process the  request due to something that is  perceived to be a
 *     client  error (e.g.,  malformed request  syntax, invalid  request message
 *     framing, or deceptive request routing).
 *
 *   * HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED --- 401 Unauthorized (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The request  requires user authentication.   The response MUST  include a
 *     WWW-Authenticate  header field  (section  14.47)  containing a  challenge
 *     applicable to the requested resource.   The client MAY repeat the request
 *     with  a  suitable Authorization  header  field  (section 14.8).   If  the
 *     request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401 response
 *     indicates that authorization has been  refused for those credentials.  If
 *     the 401 response  contains the same challenge as the  prior response, and
 *     the user agent  has already attempted authentication at  least once, then
 *     the user SHOULD  be presented the entity that was  given in the response,
 *     since that  entity might  include relevant diagnostic  information.  HTTP
 *     access  authentication is  explained in  "HTTP Authentication:  Basic and
 *     Digest Access Authentication" [43].
 *
 *   * HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED --- 401 Unauthorized (from RFC 7235)
 *
 *     The 401  (Unauthorized) status  code indicates that  the request  has not
 *     been applied  because it lacks  valid authentication credentials  for the
 *     target  resource.  The  server  generating  a 401  response  MUST send  a
 *     WWW-Authenticate  header  field (Section  4.1)  containing  at least  one
 *     challenge applicable to the target resource.
 *
 *     If the request included authentication credentials, then the 401 response
 *     indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials.  The
 *     user agent  MAY repeat the request  with a new or  replaced Authorization
 *     header  field (Section  4.2).   If  the 401  response  contains the  same
 *     challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has already attempted
 *     authentication  at least  once, then  the user  agent SHOULD  present the
 *     enclosed representation to  the user, since it  usually contains relevant
 *     diagnostic information.
 *
 *   * HTTP_PAYMENT_REQUIRED --- 402 Payment Required (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     This code is reserved for future use.
 *
 *   * HTTP_PAYMENT_REQUIRED --- 402 Payment Required (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 402 (Payment Required) status code is reserved for future use.
 *
 *   * HTTP_FORBIDDEN --- 403 Forbidden (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The  server  understood the  request,  but  is  refusing to  fulfill  it.
 *     Authorization will not  help and the request SHOULD NOT  be repeated.  If
 *     the request method was not HEAD and  the server wishes to make public why
 *     the request has not been fulfilled, it SHOULD describe the reason for the
 *     refusal  in  the entity.   If  the  server does  not  wish  to make  this
 *     information available to the client, the  status code 404 (Not Found) can
 *     be used instead.
 *
 *   * HTTP_FORBIDDEN --- 403 Forbidden (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 403 (Forbidden) status code  indicates that the server understood the
 *     request but refuses to authorize it.  A server that wishes to make public
 *     why  the request  has  been forbidden  can describe  that  reason in  the
 *     response payload (if any).
 *
 *     If authentication  credentials were provided  in the request,  the server
 *     considers  them insufficient  to  grant access.   The  client SHOULD  NOT
 *     automatically repeat the  request with the same  credentials.  The client
 *     MAY repeat  the request  with new or  different credentials.   However, a
 *     request might be forbidden for reasons unrelated to the credentials.
 *
 *     An  origin server  that  wishes  to "hide"  the  current  existence of  a
 *     forbidden target resource  MAY instead respond with a status  code of 404
 *     (Not Found).
 *
 *   * HTTP_NOT_FOUND --- 404 Not Found (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The  server  has  not  found   anything  matching  the  Request-URI.   No
 *     indication is given  of whether the condition is  temporary or permanent.
 *     The 410  (Gone) status code SHOULD  be used if the  server knows, through
 *     some  internally   configurable  mechanism,  that  an   old  resource  is
 *     permanently unavailable and has no  forwarding address.  This status code
 *     is commonly used when the server does  not wish to reveal exactly why the
 *     request has been refused, or when no other response is applicable.
 *
 *   * HTTP_NOT_FOUND --- 404 Not Found (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 404 (Not Found) status code  indicates that the origin server did not
 *     find a current  representation for the target resource or  is not willing
 *     to disclose that one exists.  A 404 status code does not indicate whether
 *     this lack  of representation  is temporary or  permanent; the  410 (Gone)
 *     status code is preferred over 404  if the origin server knows, presumably
 *     through  some configurable  means, that  the  condition is  likely to  be
 *     permanent.
 *
 *     A 404 response is cacheable  by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
 *     by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
 *     [RFC7234]).
 *
 *   * HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED --- 405 Method Not Allowed (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The method specified in the Request-Line  is not allowed for the resource
 *     identified by the Request-URI.  The response MUST include an Allow header
 *     containing a list of valid methods for the requested resource.
 *
 *   * HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED --- 405 Method Not Allowed (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The  405 (Method  Not  Allowed)  status code  indicates  that the  method
 *     received  in the  request-line  is known  by the  origin  server but  not
 *     supported by  the target  resource.  The origin  server MUST  generate an
 *     Allow header  field in  a 405  response containing a  list of  the target
 *     resource's currently supported methods.
 *
 *     A 405 response is cacheable  by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
 *     by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
 *     [RFC7234]).
 *
 *   * HTTP_NOT_ACCEPTABLE --- 406 Not Acceptable (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The  resource identified  by the  request is  only capable  of generating
 *     response  entities  which  have content  characteristics  not  acceptable
 *     according to the accept headers sent in the request.
 *
 *     Unless  it was  a HEAD  request, the  response SHOULD  include an  entity
 *     containing  a list  of available  entity characteristics  and location(s)
 *     from which  the user or user  agent can choose the  one most appropriate.
 *     The  entity  format  is  specified  by   the  media  type  given  in  the
 *     Content-Type   header  field.    Depending  upon   the  format   and  the
 *     capabilities of the user agent,  selection of the most appropriate choice
 *     MAY  be performed  automatically.  However,  this specification  does not
 *     define any standard for such automatic selection.
 *
 *     Note:  HTTP/1.1 servers  are allowed  to return  responses which  are not
 *     acceptable according to the accept headers  sent in the request.  In some
 *     cases,  this may  even be  preferable to  sending a  406 response.   User
 *     agents are encouraged  to inspect the headers of an  incoming response to
 *     determine if it is acceptable.
 *
 *     If the  response could  be unacceptable, a  user agent  SHOULD emporarily
 *     stop receipt of  more data and query  the user for a  decision on further
 *     actions.
 *
 *   * HTTP_NOT_ACCEPTABLE --- 406 Not Acceptable (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 406 (Not  Acceptable) status code indicates that  the target resource
 *     does not  have a current representation  that would be acceptable  to the
 *     user agent, according to the proactive negotiation header fields received
 *     in the  request (Section 5.3),  and the server  is unwilling to  supply a
 *     default representation.
 *
 *     The  server SHOULD  generate a  payload  containing a  list of  available
 *     representation  characteristics  and corresponding  resource  identifiers
 *     from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate.  A
 *     user agent MAY automatically select the most appropriate choice from that
 *     list.  However, this specification does  not define any standard for such
 *     automatic selection, as described in Section 6.4.1.
 *
 *   * HTTP_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED --- 407  Proxy Authentication Required
 *     (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     This code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but indicates that the client
 *     must first authenticate  itself with the proxy.  The proxy  MUST return a
 *     Proxy-Authenticate header  field (section  14.33) containing  a challenge
 *     applicable  to the  proxy for  the  requested resource.   The client  MAY
 *     repeat  the  request with  a  suitable  Proxy-Authorization header  field
 *     (section  14.34).   HTTP  access  authentication is  explained  in  "HTTP
 *     Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication" [43].
 *
 *   * HTTP_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED --- 407  Proxy Authentication Required
 *     (from RFC 7235)
 *
 *      The 407  (Proxy Authentication Required)  status code is similar  to 401
 *      (Unauthorized), but it  indicates that the client  needs to authenticate
 *      itself   in  order   to   use  a   proxy.   The   proxy   MUST  send   a
 *      Proxy-Authenticate  header field  (Section 4.3)  containing a  challenge
 *      applicable to that proxy for the target resource.  The client MAY repeat
 *      the  request with  a new  or replaced  Proxy-Authorization header  field
 *      (Section 4.4).
 *
 *   * HTTP_REQUEST_TIME_OUT --- 408 Request Timeout (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The client did not produce a request  within the time that the server was
 *     prepared  to   wait.   The   client  MAY   repeat  the   request  without
 *     modifications at any later time.
 *
 *   * HTTP_REQUEST_TIME_OUT --- 408 Request Timeout (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 408 (Request  Timeout) status code indicates that the  server did not
 *     receive a complete  request message within the time that  it was prepared
 *     to wait.  A server SHOULD send the "close" connection option (Section 6.1
 *     of [RFC7230])  in the  response, since  408 implies  that the  server has
 *     decided to  close the  connection rather than  continue waiting.   If the
 *     client has an outstanding request in  transit, the client MAY repeat that
 *     request on a new connection.
 *
 *   * HTTP_CONFLICT --- 409 Conflict (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The request  could not be  completed due to  a conflict with  the current
 *     state of the resource.  This code  is only allowed in situations where it
 *     is  expected that  the user  might be  able to  resolve the  conflict and
 *     resubmit  the   request.   The   response  body  SHOULD   include  enough
 *     information  for  the user  to  recognize  the  source of  the  conflict.
 *     Ideally, the  response entity  would include  enough information  for the
 *     user  or user  agent  to fix  the  problem; however,  that  might not  be
 *     possible and is not required.
 *
 *     Conflicts are  most likely to  occur in response  to a PUT  request.  For
 *     example, if versioning were being used  and the entity being PUT included
 *     changes  to a  resource  which conflict  with those  made  by an  earlier
 *     (third-party) request, the server might  use the 409 response to indicate
 *     that it  can't complete the request.   In this case, the  response entity
 *     would likely contain  a list of the differences between  the two versions
 *     in a format defined by the response Content-Type.
 *
 *   * HTTP_CONFLICT --- 409 Conflict (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 409  (Conflict) status code indicates  that the request could  not be
 *     completed  due  to a  conflict  with  the  current  state of  the  target
 *     resource.  This code  is used in situations where the  user might be able
 *     to  resolve the  conflict and  resubmit the  request.  The  server SHOULD
 *     generate  a  payload that  includes  enough  information  for a  user  to
 *     recognize the source of the conflict.
 *
 *     Conflicts are  most likely to  occur in response  to a PUT  request.  For
 *     example, if versioning  were being used and the  representation being PUT
 *     included  changes to  a  resource that  conflict with  those  made by  an
 *     earlier (third-party) request, the origin server might use a 409 response
 *     to  indicate that  it  can't complete  the request.   In  this case,  the
 *     response  representation  would  likely contain  information  useful  for
 *     merging the differences based on the revision history.
 *
 *   * HTTP_GONE --- 410 Gone (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The  requested resource  is  no longer  available at  the  server and  no
 *     forwarding address is known.  This condition is expected to be considered
 *     permanent.   Clients   with  link  editing  capabilities   SHOULD  delete
 *     references to  the Request-URI after  user approval.  If the  server does
 *     not know, or  has no facility to determine, whether  or not the condition
 *     is permanent,  the status code  404 (Not  Found) SHOULD be  used instead.
 *     This response is cacheable unless indicated otherwise.
 *
 *     The  410  response is  primarily  intended  to  assist  the task  of  web
 *     maintenance by notifying the recipient that the resource is intentionally
 *     unavailable and that  the server owners desire that remote  links to that
 *     resource  be  removed.   Such  an   event  is  common  for  limited-time,
 *     promotional services and for resources belonging to individuals no longer
 *     working  at  the  server's  site.   It  is  not  necessary  to  mark  all
 *     permanently unavailable resources  as "gone" or to keep the  mark for any
 *     length of time -- that is left to the discretion of the server owner.
 *
 *   * HTTP_GONE --- 410 Gone (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 410 (Gone)  status code indicates that access to  the target resource
 *     is no  longer available at the  origin server and that  this condition is
 *     likely to be  permanent.  If the origin  server does not know,  or has no
 *     facility to  determine, whether  or not the  condition is  permanent, the
 *     status code 404 (Not Found) ought to be used instead.
 *
 *     The  410  response is  primarily  intended  to  assist  the task  of  web
 *     maintenance by notifying the recipient that the resource is intentionally
 *     unavailable and that  the server owners desire that remote  links to that
 *     resource  be  removed.   Such  an   event  is  common  for  limited-time,
 *     promotional services and for resources belonging to individuals no longer
 *     associated with  the origin server's site.   It is not necessary  to mark
 *     all permanently unavailable  resources as "gone" or to keep  the mark for
 *     any length of time -- that is left to the discretion of the server owner.
 *
 *     A 410 response is cacheable  by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
 *     by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
 *     [RFC7234]).
 *
 *   * HTTP_LENGTH_REQUIRED --- 411 Length Required (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The   server  refuses   to   accept  the   request   without  a   defined
 *     Content-Length.  The  client MAY repeat  the request  if it adds  a valid
 *     Content-Length header field containing the  length of the message-body in
 *     the request message.
 *
 *   * HTTP_LENGTH_REQUIRED --- 411 Length Required (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 411 (Length  Required) status code indicates that  the server refuses
 *     to accept the request without  a defined Content-Length (Section 3.3.2 of
 *     [RFC7230]).   The client  MAY  repeat  the request  if  it  adds a  valid
 *     Content-Length header field containing the  length of the message body in
 *     the request message.
 *
 *   * HTTP_PRECONDITION_FAILED --- 412 Precondition Failed (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The  precondition given  in  one  or more  of  the request-header  fields
 *     evaluated to false when it was  tested on the server.  This response code
 *     allows  the  client  to  place  preconditions  on  the  current  resource
 *     metainformation (header field data) and thus prevent the requested method
 *     from being applied to a resource other than the one intended.
 *
 *   * HTTP_PRECONDITION_FAILED --- 412 Precondition Failed (from RFC 7232)
 *
 *     The  412 (Precondition  Failed) status  code indicates  that one  or more
 *     conditions given  in the  request header fields  evaluated to  false when
 *     tested on  the server.   This response  code allows  the client  to place
 *     preconditions on the current  resource state (its current representations
 *     and metadata) and, thus, prevent the request method from being applied if
 *     the target resource is in an unexpected state.
 *
 *   * HTTP_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE --- 413 Request  Entity Too Large (from RFC
 *     2616)
 *
 *     The server is refusing to process a request because the request entity is
 *     larger than  the server is  willing or able  to process.  The  server MAY
 *     close the connection to prevent the client from continuing the request.
 *
 *     If the  condition is temporary,  the server SHOULD include  a Retry-After
 *     header field  to indicate that  it is temporary  and after what  time the
 *     client MAY try again.
 *
 *   * HTTP_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE --- 413 Request  Entity Too Large (from RFC
 *     7231)
 *
 *     The 413  (Payload Too  Large) status  code indicates  that the  server is
 *     refusing to process a request because  the request payload is larger than
 *     the  server is  willing or  able to  process.  The  server MAY  close the
 *     connection to prevent the client from continuing the request.
 *
 *     If the condition  is temporary, the server SHOULD  generate a Retry-After
 *     header field  to indicate that  it is temporary  and after what  time the
 *     client MAY try again.
 *
 *   * HTTP_REQUEST_URI_TOO_LARGE --- 414 Request-URI Too Long (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The server is refusing to service  the request because the Request-URI is
 *     longer than the  server is willing to interpret.  This  rare condition is
 *     only  likely to  occur  when a  client has  improperly  converted a  POST
 *     request to a GET request with long query information, when the client has
 *     descended into a URI "black hole"  of redirection (e.g., a redirected URI
 *     prefix that points  to a suffix of  itself), or when the  server is under
 *     attack by a  client attempting to exploit security holes  present in some
 *     servers  using  fixed-length  buffers  for reading  or  manipulating  the
 *     Request-URI.
 *
 *   * HTTP_REQUEST_URI_TOO_LARGE --- 414 Request-URI Too Long (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 414 (URI Too Long) status  code indicates that the server is refusing
 *     to  service  the  request  because the  request-target  (Section  5.3  of
 *     [RFC7230]) is longer than the server  is willing to interpret.  This rare
 *     condition is only likely to occur  when a client has improperly converted
 *     a POST  request to a  GET request with  long query information,  when the
 *     client  has  descended  into  a  "black hole"  of  redirection  (e.g.,  a
 *     redirected URI  prefix that  points to  a suffix of  itself) or  when the
 *     server  is under  attack  by  a client  attempting  to exploit  potential
 *     security holes.
 *
 *     A 414 response is cacheable  by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
 *     by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
 *     [RFC7234]).
 *
 *   * HTTP_UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE  --- 415  Unsupported  Media  Type (from  RFC
 *     2616)
 *
 *     The server is  refusing to service the request because  the entity of the
 *     request is  in a format not  supported by the requested  resource for the
 *     requested method.
 *
 *   * HTTP_UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE  --- 415  Unsupported  Media  Type (from  RFC
 *     7231)
 *
 *     The 415  (Unsupported Media Type)  status code indicates that  the origin
 *     server is  refusing to service  the request because  the payload is  in a
 *     format not supported  by this method on the target  resource.  The format
 *     problem  might  be  due  to   the  request's  indicated  Content-Type  or
 *     Content-Encoding, or as a result of inspecting the data directly.
 *
 *   * HTTP_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE --- 416 Requested  Range Not Satisfiable (from
 *     RFC 2616)
 *
 *     A server  SHOULD return  a response  with this status  code if  a request
 *     included a  Range request-header field  (section 14.35), and none  of the
 *     range-specifier values  in this field  overlap the current extent  of the
 *     selected  resource,  and   the  request  did  not   include  an  If-Range
 *     request-header   field.    (For   byte-ranges,  this   means   that   the
 *     first-byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater than the
 *     current length of the selected resource.)
 *
 *     When this status code is returned  for a byte-range request, the response
 *     SHOULD include a Content-Range entity-header field specifying the current
 *     length of the  selected resource (see section 14.16).  This response MUST
 *     NOT use the multipart/byteranges content-type.
 *
 *   * HTTP_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE --- 416 Requested  Range Not Satisfiable (from
 *     RFC 7233)
 *
 *     The 416  (Range Not Satisfiable) status  code indicates that none  of the
 *     ranges  in the  request's Range  header field  (Section 3.1)  overlap the
 *     current  extent of  the  selected  resource or  that  the  set of  ranges
 *     requested has been rejected due to invalid ranges or an excessive request
 *     of small or overlapping ranges.
 *
 *     For byte  ranges, failing to  overlap the  current extent means  that the
 *     first-byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater than the
 *     current length of the selected  representation.  When this status code is
 *     generated in response to a byte-range request, the sender SHOULD generate
 *     a  Content-Range  header  field  specifying the  current  length  of  the
 *     selected representation (Section 4.2).
 *
 *     For example:
 *
 *     <pre class="fragment">HTTP/1.1 416 Range Not Satisfiable
 * Date: Fri, 20 Jan 2012 15:41:54 GMT
 * Content-Range: bytes *&zwj;/47022</pre>
 *     .
 *
 *     Note: Because servers are free to ignore Range, many implementations will
 *     simply  respond with  the entire  selected representation  in a  200 (OK)
 *     response.  That is partly because most  clients are prepared to receive a
 *     200  (OK) to  complete  the  task (albeit  less  efficiently) and  partly
 *     because clients  might not stop  making an invalid partial  request until
 *     they  have  received a  complete  representation.   Thus, clients  cannot
 *     depend on receiving  a 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) response  even when it
 *     is most appropriate.
 *
 *   * HTTP_EXPECTATION_FAILED --- 417 Expectation Failed (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The  expectation given  in an  Expect request-header  field (see  section
 *     14.20) could not be met by this server, or, if the server is a proxy, the
 *     server has unambiguous evidence that the  request could not be met by the
 *     next-hop server.
 *
 *   * HTTP_EXPECTATION_FAILED --- 417 Expectation Failed (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 417 (Expectation  Failed) status code indicates  that the expectation
 *     given in the  request's Expect header field (Section 5.1.1)  could not be
 *     met by at least one of the inbound servers.
 *
 *   * HTTP_MISDIRECTED_REQUEST --- 421 Misdirected Request (from RFC 7540)
 *
 *     The 421 (Misdirected Request) status  code indicates that the request was
 *     directed at a server that is not able to produce a response.  This can be
 *     sent by  a server  that is  not configured to  produce responses  for the
 *     combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI.
 *
 *     Clients receiving a 421 (Misdirected  Request) response from a server MAY
 *     retry the request  -- whether the request method is  idempotent or not --
 *     over a different connection.  This is  possible if a connection is reused
 *     (Section 9.1.1) or if an alternative service is selected [ALT-SVC].
 *
 *     This status code MUST NOT be generated by proxies.
 *
 *     A 421 response is cacheable  by default, i.e., unless otherwise indicated
 *     by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
 *     [RFC7234]).
 *
 *   * HTTP_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY --- 422 Unprocessable Entity (from RFC 2518)
 *
 *     The 422 (Unprocessable  Entity) status code means  the server understands
 *     the content  type of  the request entity  (hence a  415(Unsupported Media
 *     Type) status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity
 *     is correct  (thus a 400 (Bad  Request) status code is  inappropriate) but
 *     was  unable to  process the  contained instructions.   For example,  this
 *     error condition  may occur  if an XML  request body  contains well-formed
 *     (i.e.,   syntactically   correct),   but   semantically   erroneous   XML
 *     instructions.
 *
 *   * HTTP_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY --- 422 Unprocessable Entity (from RFC 4918)
 *
 *     The 422 (Unprocessable  Entity) status code means  the server understands
 *     the content  type of  the request entity  (hence a  415(Unsupported Media
 *     Type) status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity
 *     is correct  (thus a 400 (Bad  Request) status code is  inappropriate) but
 *     was  unable to  process the  contained instructions.   For example,  this
 *     error condition  may occur  if an XML  request body  contains well-formed
 *     (i.e.,   syntactically   correct),   but  semantically   erroneous,   XML
 *     instructions.
 *
 *   * HTTP_LOCKED --- 423  Locked (from RFC 2518)
 *
 *     The 423 (Locked) status code means  the source or destination resource of
 *     a method is locked.
 *
 *   * HTTP_LOCKED --- 423  Locked (from RFC 4918)
 *
 *     The 423 (Locked) status code means  the source or destination resource of
 *     a  method  is  locked.   This  response  SHOULD  contain  an  appropriate
 *     precondition  or postcondition  code, such  as 'lock-token-submitted'  or
 *     'no-conflicting-lock'.
 *
 *   * HTTP_FAILED_DEPENDENCY --- 424 Failed Dependency (from RFC 2518)
 *
 *     The 424 (Failed  Dependency) status code means that the  method could not
 *     be performed  on the  resource because the  requested action  depended on
 *     another action  and that action failed.   For example, if a  command in a
 *     PROPPATCH method  fails then, at minimum,  the rest of the  commands will
 *     also fail with 424 (Failed Dependency).
 *
 *   * HTTP_FAILED_DEPENDENCY --- 424 Failed Dependency (from RFC 4918)
 *
 *     The 424 (Failed  Dependency) status code means that the  method could not
 *     be performed  on the  resource because the  requested action  depended on
 *     another action  and that action failed.   For example, if a  command in a
 *     PROPPATCH method fails,  then, at minimum, the rest of  the commands will
 *     also fail with 424 (Failed Dependency).
 *
 *   * HTTP_UPGRADE_REQUIRED --- 426 Upgrade Required (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 426 (Upgrade Required) status  code indicates that the server refuses
 *     to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to
 *     do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol.  The server MUST
 *     send an Upgrade  header field in a 426 response  to indicate the required
 *     protocol(s) (Section 6.7 of [RFC7230]).
 *
 *     Example:
 *
 *         HTTP/1.1 426 Upgrade Required
 *         Upgrade: HTTP/3.0
 *         Connection: Upgrade
 *         Content-Length: 53
 *         Content-Type: text/plain
 *
 *         This service requires use of the HTTP/3.0 protocol.
 *
 *   * HTTP_PRECONDITION_REQUIRED --- 428 Precondition Required (from RFC 6585)
 *
 *     The 428 status code indicates that the origin server requires the request
 *     to be conditional.
 *
 *     Its typical  use is to  avoid the "lost  update" problem, where  a client
 *     GETs a  resource's state, modifies  it, and PUTs  it back to  the server,
 *     when  meanwhile a  third  party has  modified the  state  on the  server,
 *     leading  to a  conflict.  By  requiring requests  to be  conditional, the
 *     server can assure that clients are working with the correct copies.
 *
 *     Responses  using this  status code  SHOULD  explain how  to resubmit  the
 *     request successfully.  For example:
 *
 *         HTTP/1.1 428 Precondition Requiredy
 *         Content-Type: text/html
 *
 *         <html>
 *           <head>
 *             <title>Precondition Required</title>
 *           </head>
 *           <body>
 *             <h1>Precondition Required</h1>
 *             <p>This request is required to be conditional;
 *             try using "If-Match".</p>
 *           </body>
 *         </html>
 *
 *     Responses with the 428 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.
 *
 *   * HTTP_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS --- 429 Too Many Requests (from RFC 6585)
 *
 *     The 429 status code indicates that the user has sent too many requests in
 *     a given amount of time ("rate limiting").
 *
 *     The  response  representations  SHOULD  include  details  explaining  the
 *     condition, and  MAY include a  Retry-After header indicating how  long to
 *     wait before making a new request.
 *
 *     For example:
 *
 *         HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
 *         Content-Type: text/html
 *         Retry-After: 3600
 *
 *         <html>
 *           <head>
 *             <title>Too Many Requests</title>
 *           </head>
 *           <body>
 *             <h1>Too Many Requests</h1>
 *             <p>I only allow 50 requests per hour to this Web site per
 *             logged in user.  Try again soon.</p>
 *           </body>
 *         </html>
 *
 *     Note  that this  specification  does  not define  how  the origin  server
 *     identifies the user, nor how it  counts requests.  For example, an origin
 *     server that  is limiting  request rates  can do so  based upon  counts of
 *     requests on a per-resource basis, across the entire server, or even among
 *     a  set  of  servers.   Likewise,  it  might  identify  the  user  by  its
 *     authentication credentials, or a stateful cookie.
 *
 *     Responses with the 429 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.
 *
 *   * HTTP_REQUEST_HEADER_FIELDS_TOO_LARGE  --- 431  Request Header  Fields Too
 *     Large (from RFC 6585)
 *
 *     The 431 status code indicates that the server is unwilling to process the
 *     request because  its header  fields are  too large.   The request  MAY be
 *     resubmitted after reducing the size of the request header fields.
 *
 *     It can be used both when the set of request header fields in total is too
 *     large, and when a  single header field is at fault.   In the latter case,
 *     the response  representation SHOULD  specify which  header field  was too
 *     large.
 *
 *     For example:
 *
 *         HTTP/1.1 431 Request Header Fields Too Large
 *         Content-Type: text/html
 *
 *         <html>
 *           <head>
 *             <title>Request Header Fields Too Large</title>
 *           </head>
 *           <body>
 *             <h1>Request Header Fields Too Large</h1>
 *             <p>The "Example" header was too large.</p>
 *           </body>
 *         </html>
 *
 *     Responses with the 431 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.
 *
 *   * HTTP_UNAVAILABLE_FOR_LEGAL_REASONS --- 451  Unavailable For Legal Reasons
 *     (from RFC 7725)
 *
 *     This  status code  indicates that  the server  is denying  access to  the
 *     resource as a consequence of a legal demand.
 *
 *     The server in question might not be an origin server.  This type of legal
 *     demand typically most directly affects  the operations of ISPs and search
 *     engines.
 *
 *     Responses using  this status code  SHOULD include an explanation,  in the
 *     response body, of  the details of the legal demand:  the party making it,
 *     the applicable legislation or regulation,  and what classes of person and
 *     resource it applies to.  For example:
 *
 *         HTTP/1.1 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons
 *         Link: <https://spqr.example.org/legislatione>; rel="blocked-by"
 *         Content-Type: text/html
 *
 *         <html>
 *           <head><title>Unavailable For Legal Reasons</title></head>
 *           <body>
 *             <h1>Unavailable For Legal Reasons</h1>
 *             <p>This request may not be serviced in the Roman Province
 *             of Judea due to the Lex Julia Majestatis, which disallows
 *             access to resources hosted on servers deemed to be
 *             oerated by the People's Front of Judea.</p>
 *           </body>
 *         </html>
 *
 *     The  use  of the  451  status  code  implies  neither the  existence  nor
 *     nonexistence of the resource named in the request.  That is to say, it is
 *     possible  that if  the  legal demands  were removed,  a  request for  the
 *     resource still might not succeed.
 *
 *     Note that in  many cases clients can still access  the denied resource by
 *     using technical countermeasures such as a VPN or the Tor network.
 *
 *     A 451 response is cacheable  by default, i.e., unless otherwise indicated
 *     by the method definition or explicit cache controls; see [RFC7234].
 *
 * * Server Error 5xx (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *   Response status codes beginning with the  digit "5" indicate cases in which
 *   the server  is aware that  it has erred or  is incapable of  performing the
 *   request.   Except when  responding to  a  HEAD request,  the server  SHOULD
 *   include an  entity containing  an explanation of  the error  situation, and
 *   whether  it is  a temporary  or  permanent condition.   User agents  SHOULD
 *   display  any  included  entity  to  the  user.  These  response  codes  are
 *   applicable to any request method.
 *
 * * Server Error 5xx (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *   The 5xx  (Server Error) class of  status code indicates that  the server is
 *   aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the requested method.
 *   Except  when  responding to  a  HEAD  request,  the  server SHOULD  send  a
 *   representation  containing  an  explanation  of the  error  situation,  and
 *   whether it  is a  temporary or  permanent condition.   A user  agent SHOULD
 *   display any included representation to  the user.  These response codes are
 *   applicable to any request method.
 *
 *   * HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR --- 500 Internal Server Error (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The server  encountered an unexpected  condition which prevented  it from
 *     fulfilling the request.
 *
 *   * HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR --- 500 Internal Server Error (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 500  (Internal Server  Error) status code  indicates that  the server
 *     encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the
 *     request.
 *
 *   * HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED --- 501 Not Implemented (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The server  does not  support the functionality  required to  fulfill the
 *     request.   This is  the appropriate  response  when the  server does  not
 *     recognize the request method and is  not capable of supporting it for any
 *     resource.
 *
 *   * HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED --- 501 Not Implemented (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 501 (Not Implemented) status code  indicates that the server does not
 *     support the functionality  required to fulfill the request.   This is the
 *     appropriate  response when  the  server does  not  recognize the  request
 *     method and is not capable of supporting it for any resource.
 *
 *     A 501 response is cacheable  by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
 *     by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of
 *     [RFC7234]).
 *
 *   * HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY --- 502 Bad Gateway (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The  server, while  acting as  a gateway  or proxy,  received an  invalid
 *     response from  the upstream server  it accessed in attempting  to fulfill
 *     the request.
 *
 *   * HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY --- 502 Bad Gateway (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 502 (Bad Gateway) status code indicates that the server, while acting
 *     as  a gateway  or proxy,  received an  invalid response  from an  inbound
 *     server it accessed while attempting to fulfill the request.
 *
 *   * HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE --- 503 Service Unavailable (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The server is  currently unable to handle the request  due to a temporary
 *     overloading or maintenance  of the server.  The implication  is that this
 *     is a temporary  condition which will be alleviated after  some delay.  If
 *     known, the length of the delay  MAY be indicated in a Retry-After header.
 *     If no Retry-After  is given, the client SHOULD handle  the response as it
 *     would for a 500 response.
 *
 *     Note: The existence of  the 503 status code does not  imply that a server
 *     must use  it when becoming overloaded.   Some servers may wish  to simply
 *     refuse the connection.
 *
 *   * HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE --- 503 Service Unavailable (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 503  (Service Unavailable) status  code indicates that the  server is
 *     currently unable  to handle the  request due  to a temporary  overload or
 *     scheduled maintenance, which will likely  be alleviated after some delay.
 *     The server MAY send a Retry-After header field (Section 7.1.3) to suggest
 *     an appropriate amount of time for  the client to wait before retrying the
 *     request.
 *
 *     Note: The existence of  the 503 status code does not  imply that a server
 *     has to use it when becoming overloaded.  Some servers might simply refuse
 *     the connection.
 *
 *   * HTTP_GATEWAY_TIME_OUT --- 504 Gateway Timeout (from RFC 2616)
 *
 *     The server, while acting as a gateway  or proxy, did not receive a timely
 *     response from the upstream server specified  by the URI (e.g.  HTTP, FTP,
 *     LDAP) or  some other auxiliary server  (e.g. DNS) it needed  to access in
 *     attempting to complete the request.
 *
 *     Note: Note to implementors: some deployed proxies are known to return 400
 *     or 500 when DNS lookups time out.
 *
 *   * HTTP_GATEWAY_TIME_OUT --- 504 Gateway Timeout (from RFC 7231)
 *
 *     The 504  (Gateway Timeout) status  code indicates that the  server, while
 *     acting as a gateway  or proxy, did not receive a  timely response from an
 *     upstream server it needed to access in order to complete the request.
 *
 *   * HTTP_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED ---  505 HTTP Version Not  Supported (from RFC
 *     2616)
 *
 *     The server  does not support,  or refuses  to support, the  HTTP protocol
 *     version that was  used in the request message.  The  server is indicating
 *     that it  is unable or  unwilling to complete  the request using  the same
 *     major version as the client, as described in section 3.1, other than with
 *     this error message.  The response SHOULD contain an entity describing why
 *     that version is  not supported and what other protocols  are supported by
 *     that server.
 *
 *   * HTTP_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED ---  505 HTTP Version Not  Supported (from RFC
 *     7231)
 *
 *     The  505 (HTTP  Version Not  Supported)  status code  indicates that  the
 *     server does not support, or refuses to support, the major version of HTTP
 *     that was used  in the request message.  The server  is indicating that it
 *     is  unable or  unwilling to  complete the  request using  the same  major
 *     version as  the client, as described  in Section 2.6 of  [RFC7230], other
 *     than   with  this   error  message.    The  server   SHOULD  generate   a
 *     representation for  the 505 response  that describes why that  version is
 *     not supported and what other protocols are supported by that server.
 *
 *   * HTTP_VARIANT_ALSO_VARIES --- 506 Variant Also Negotiates (from RFC 2295)
 *
 *     The  506  status   code  indicates  that  the  server   has  an  internal
 *     configuration error: the chosen variant  resource is configured to engage
 *     in transparent content negotiation itself,  and is therefore not a proper
 *     end point in the negotiation process.
 *
 *   * HTTP_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE --- 507 Insufficient Storage (from RFC 2518)
 *
 *     The 507 (Insufficient Storage) status code  means the method could not be
 *     performed  on the  resource because  the server  is unable  to store  the
 *     representation  needed  to  successfully   complete  the  request.   This
 *     condition is considered  to be temporary.  If the  request which received
 *     this status code was the result of a user action, the request MUST NOT be
 *     repeated until it is requested by a separate user action.
 *
 *   * HTTP_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE --- 507 Insufficient Storage (from RFC 4918)
 *
 *     The 507 (Insufficient Storage) status code  means the method could not be
 *     performed  on the  resource because  the server  is unable  to store  the
 *     representation  needed  to  successfully   complete  the  request.   This
 *     condition is  considered to be  temporary.  If the request  that received
 *     this status code was the result of a user action, the request MUST NOT be
 *     repeated until it is requested by a separate user action.
 *
 *   * HTTP_LOOP_DETECTED --- 508 Loop Detected (from RFC 5842)
 *
 *     The 508 (Loop Detected) status  code indicates that the server terminated
 *     an operation because  it encountered an infinite loop  while processing a
 *     request with  "Depth: infinity".  This  status indicates that  the entire
 *     operation failed.
 *
 *   * HTTP_NOT_EXTENDED --- 510 Not Extended (from RFC 2774)
 *
 *     The policy  for accessing the resource  has not been met  in the request.
 *     The server should send back all  the information necessary for the client
 *     to  issue  an  extended  request.   It  is  outside  the  scope  of  this
 *     specification to specify how the extensions inform the client.
 *
 *     If the 510  response contains information about extensions  that were not
 *     present in the initial request then  the client MAY repeat the request if
 *     it has reason to believe it can fulfill the extension policy by modifying
 *     the request  according to the  information provided in the  510 response.
 *     Otherwise the client MAY present any  entity included in the 510 response
 *     to  the  user,   since  that  entity  may   include  relevant  diagnostic
 *     information.
 *
 *   * HTTP_NETWORK_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED   ---  511   Network  Authentication
 *     Required (from RFC 6585)
 *
 *     The 511  status code indicates that  the client needs to  authenticate to
 *     gain network access.
 *
 *     The  response representation  SHOULD contain  a link  to a  resource that
 *     allows the user to submit credentials (e.g., with an HTML form).
 *
 *     Note that  the 511 response SHOULD  NOT contain a challenge  or the login
 *     interface  itself, because  browsers would  show the  login interface  as
 *     being  associated with  the  originally requested  URL,  which may  cause
 *     confusion.
 *
 *     The 511 status SHOULD NOT be  generated by origin servers; it is intended
 *     for  use by  intercepting  proxies  that are  interposed  as  a means  of
 *     controlling access to the network.
 *
 *     Responses with the 511 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.

 * Enumerator:
 *
 * AP_FTYPE_RESOURCE ---  These filters are  used to  alter the content  that is
 *   passed through them.  Examples are SSI or PHP.
 *
 * AP_FTYPE_CONTENT_SET ---  These filters are  used to  alter the content  as a
 *   whole, but after all AP_FTYPE_RESOURCE filters are executed.  These filters
 *   should not change the content-type.  An example is deflate.
 *
 * AP_FTYPE_PROTOCOL --- These  filters are used to handle  the protocol between
 *   server and client.  Examples are HTTP and POP.
 *
 * AP_FTYPE_TRANSCODE  --- These  filters implement  transport encodings  (e.g.,
 *   chunking).
 *
 * AP_FTYPE_CONNECTION ---  These filters  will alter the  content, but  in ways
 *   that  are  more strongly  associated  with  the connection.   Examples  are
 *   splitting  an HTTP  connection into  multiple requests  and buffering  HTTP
 *   responses across multiple requests.
 *
 *   It is important  to note that these  types of filters are not  allowed in a
 *   sub-request.   A   sub-request's  output  can  certainly   be  filtered  by
 *   AP_FTYPE_RESOURCE filters, but all of  the "final processing" is determined
 *   by the main request.
 *
 * AP_FTYPE_NETWORK  ---  These  filters  don't alter  the  content.   They  are
 *   responsible for sending/receiving data to/from the client.
 *
 * Protocol flags: logical OR of AP_FILTER_PROTO_* bits:
 *
 * AP_FILTER_PROTO_CHANGE   ---  Filter   changes   contents  (so   invalidating
 *   checksums/etc).
 *
 * AP_FILTER_PROTO_CHANGE_LENGTH  ---  Filter  changes length  of  contents  (so
 *   invalidating content-length/etc).
 *
 * AP_FILTER_PROTO_NO_BYTERANGE  --- Filter  requires complete  input and  can't
 * work on byteranges.
 *
 * AP_FILTER_PROTO_NO_CACHE --- Filter makes output non-cacheable.
 *
 * AP_FILTER_PROTO_NO_PROXY --- Filter should not run in a proxy.
 *
 * AP_FILTER_PROTO_TRANSFORM  --- Filter  is  incompatible with  "Cache-Control:
 * no-transform".
 *
 * @see [Apache HTTP Server --- Core routines --- Filter Chain](https://ci.apache.org/projects/httpd/trunk/doxygen/group__APACHE__CORE__FILTER.html)
